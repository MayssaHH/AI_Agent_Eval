# Evaluating AI Agents: From Component Checks to Adversarial Defense

**Packt Live Online Training Course**

A hands-on 4-hour course that teaches you how to evaluate AI agents at four progressive layers:
component decisions, execution trajectories, output quality, and adversarial robustness.

All notebooks run **completely offline** using a deterministic mock research assistant agent.
No API keys required.

## Notebook Descriptions

### Notebook 1 — Component-Level Evaluation (`01_component_evaluation.ipynb`)

**What:** Evaluates individual tool-selection and argument-generation decisions.

**Key metrics:** Tool-selection accuracy, argument exact match, argument field-level F1.

**You will learn:** How a correct final answer can hide wrong tool choices or malformed arguments that compound into larger failures.

**Estimated runtime:** ~2 minutes

---

### Notebook 2 — Trajectory Evaluation (`02_trajectory_evaluation.ipynb`)

**What:** Inspects full agent execution paths for structural problems.

**Key metrics:** Step count, latency, token cost, duplicate detection, loop detection, recovery assertion.

**You will learn:** How two agents with the same answer can differ dramatically in reliability and efficiency — and how to catch the difference with assertions.

**Estimated runtime:** ~2 minutes

---

### Notebook 3 — Outcome Evaluation and LLM-as-Judge Calibration (`03_outcome_evaluation_llm_judge.ipynb`)

**What:** Scores agent outputs on a multi-dimensional rubric and calibrates an automated judge against human labels.

**Key metrics:** Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, MAE, agreement-within-1 per rubric dimension.

**You will learn:** How to measure whether an LLM judge is reliable enough to trust for automated regression, and which rubric dimensions are hardest to automate.

**Estimated runtime:** ~2 minutes

---

### Notebook 4 — Adversarial Evaluation and Production Readiness (`04_adversarial_evaluation.ipynb`)

**What:** Tests the agent against indirect prompt injection, instruction overrides, and data exfiltration attempts.

**Key metrics:** Attack success rate, resistance rate, severity-weighted failures, breakdown by attack type.

**You will learn:** Why guardrails must be measured empirically and how to build an adversarial regression suite.

**Estimated runtime:** ~2 minutes

---

## Running Offline (Default)

All four notebooks run without internet access or API keys. The mock agent uses:

- **Deterministic routing rules** in `src/mock_agent.py` — no randomness.
- **Pre-built synthetic datasets** in `data/` — realistic but small.
- **Heuristic judge** in `src/judge.py` — calibrated to make realistic mistakes.
- **Pattern-based guards** in `src/adversarial.py` — simple regex-based detection.

---

## Optional: Using a Real LLM (Notebook 3)

To replace the mock judge with a real LLM call:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API key.
2. In `notebooks/03_outcome_evaluation_llm_judge.ipynb`, change:
   ```python
   USE_REAL_LLM = False   # change to True
   ```
3. Implement `real_llm_judge()` in `src/judge.py` using your preferred provider.
   The function signature and return format are documented in the file.

## Troubleshooting

**`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`**
- Make sure you run notebooks from within the `notebooks/` directory (JupyterLab default).
- The first cell adds `..` to `sys.path` — this relies on running notebooks from `notebooks/`.

**`FileNotFoundError` on a data file**
- Run notebooks from the `notebooks/` folder, not the project root.
- Data paths use `os.path.join("..", "data", "...")` — one level up from `notebooks/`.

**Kernel not found**
- Run `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=.venv` in your activated virtual environment.

**Charts not displaying**
- Ensure `matplotlib` is installed: `pip install matplotlib`.
- In some environments, add `%matplotlib inline` at the top of the setup cell.

## Course Summary

The central message: **agent evaluation requires looking at multiple layers**.

| Layer | What it catches |
|-------|----------------|
| **Component** | Wrong tool choices and malformed arguments |
| **Trajectory** | Loops, wasted steps, missing error recovery |
| **Outcome** | Factual errors, missing groundedness, unsafe claims |
| **Adversarial** | Prompt injection, instruction override, data exfiltration |

A strong evaluation harness covers all four layers and integrates them into a regression suite that runs on every agent change.
